      "This lecture course explores the history and culture of money. It seeks to show how the monetary system we use today and take for granted as universal, is in fact the specific inheritance of a series of essentially random events that began in ancient times. We will critically reflect on the use of money in contemporary Canadian society by comparing and contrasting it to examples of money and money-like systems that have existed in other times and cultures. We will further seek to understand how money is changing today and what the implications of these changes are for economic development, addressing poverty and inequality, and political power. In so doing, we will critically evaluate money in the many forms it has taken historically, from gold, grain, beads, and shells to paper, plastic, computer code, and bitcoin.",

      "This week-long course examines the systems of land and resource management traditionally practiced by Indigenous peoples: February 21-25, 2022. It explores the role of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in documenting and understanding the complexity of ecosystems and considers the contributions of TEK and traditional land management to ecosystem maintenance and restoration. We focus primarily on examples from Indigenous Peoples in North America. The course will also address the question of how traditional land and resource management strategies and TEK can be incorporated into restoration projects, community-based research and other relevant work environments. We will focus primarily on field-based experiences to gain insight and context for putting the aforementioned concepts into practice within an Indigenous Community setting. NOTE: Course includes preparatory work before in-class dates and project work after in-class dates. Additional course fee $125.00. Lorene Kennedy Field Course Awards are available to partly offset additional costs for full-time, ES undergraduate declared majors, minors, graduate students in Environmental Studies, or students in the RNS Diploma Program. Important Note: Non-standard dates apply to this section.

It explores the role of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in documenting and understanding the complexity of ecosystems and considers the contributions of TEK and traditional land management to ecosystem maintenance and restoration. We focus primarily on examples from Indigenous Peoples in North America. The course will also address the question of how traditional land and resource management strategies and TEK can be incorporated into restoration projects, community-based research and other relevant work environments. We will focus primarily on field-based experiences to gain insight and context for putting the aforementioned concepts into practice within an Indigenous Community setting. NOTE: Course includes preparatory work before in-class dates and project work after in-class dates. Additional course fee $125.00. Lorene Kennedy Field Course Awards are available to partly offset additional costs for full-time, ES undergraduate declared majors, minors, graduate students in Environmental Studies, or students in the RNS Diploma Program.

      "This course invites students to rethink their understanding of the shoreline via diverse Indigenous political ecology approaches. Within contexts of settler colonialism, shorelines offer spaces to think with and to experience the interweaving of diverse sources of authority and knowledge. More than just sites of growing ecological concern due to rising sea levels, pollution and industrialization, shorelines around the world are important spaces of governance, sustenance and orientation for Indigenous peoples. Indigenous worldviews are centered in this course, grounded in particular places in which Indigenous knowledge, identity and law are constituted via intimate relations with water and land. As such, environmental and ecological concerns are understood to be intertwined with questions of self-determination, decolonization, and resurgence.",

      "This course invites students to rethink their understanding of the shoreline via diverse Indigenous political ecology approaches. Within contexts of settler colonialism, shorelines offer spaces to think with and to experience the interweaving of diverse sources of authority and knowledge. More than just sites of growing ecological concern due to rising sea levels, pollution and industrialization, shorelines around the world are important spaces of vernance, sustenance and orientation for Indigenous peoples. Indigenous worldviews are centered in this course, grounded in particular places in which Indigenous knowledge, identity and law are constituted via intimate relations with water and land. As such, environmental and ecological concerns are understood to be intertwined with questions of self-determination, decolonization, and resurgence.",

Statistical topics will progress from linear regression models to more advanced methods, such as linear mixed-effects models, generalized linear models, and generalized additive models. Readings will address themes in contemporary data analysis. Prior experience with R is not required; however, students enrolling in this course should have prior experience with topics such as hypothesis testing, and the normal distribution, such as covered by an introductory-level statistics or data analysis course at the undergraduate level.

      "This elective course takes an anti-racist and intersectional feminist approach to decarcerating care. It is inspired by, and draws on the leadership of past and present social movements primarily led by Black, Indigenous, people of colour scholars and activists centered around abolitionist social work, racial justice, disability justice, mad studies, transformative justice, healing justice, and mutual aid. Contemporary inspirations include: The Institute for the Development of Human Arts, The Network to Advance Abolitionist Social Work, Disability Justice Ontario’s Cops Out of Care Series, the Toronto Abolition Convergence and the Indigenous Abolitionist Study Guide, the Mutual Aid Syllabus and the Healing Histories Project. The course examines the colonial contexts and ongoing effects of carceral social work and carceral feminism, and celebrates resistance and resurgence within communities. Students will engage with community-based and academic knowledges and explore the intersections, possibilities, paradoxes and praxis for social work. Students are invited to engage in individual and collective practices of dreaming, critical reflexivity and theorizing practice alternatives.",
